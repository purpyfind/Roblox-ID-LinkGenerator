# Roblox Age Verifier
A new Roblox age verification method. Requires your cookies but doesn't store them in places other than the script. Taken from RobloxDevs, with a tutorial. Generates a verification link regardless of the account birthday, proven to work by me and a couple of Malitur Studio members.
This works on Windows and MacOS.

# Requirements
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code (any version)
- Axios (run "npm i axios")
- Basic VS Code knowledge

# Tutorial
1. Create a new file.
2. Open that file in VS Code.
3. Copy the index.js file code in this repository inside of your file.
4. Open a new terminal (thats why you need basic vs code knowledge)
5. Run "npm i axios" if you don't have axios installed already
6. Run "node YourFileName", where YourFileName is the name of your file.
## Cookie
This will be the explanation for the 7th step. You need your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie for this to work. Please be ensured that the cookie is NOT STORED ANYWHERE ON THE SCRIPT. It is open-source, meaning you can take a look at the script.
### Manually getting your cookie
1. Open the developer console for your browser (F12 for Chrome, Firefox and figure out the keybind for your own browser yourselves)
2. Go to Application --> Cookies --> .ROBLOSECURITY, copy all that
### EditThisCookie 
1. Install the EditThisCookie extension (https://www.editthiscookie.com/)
2. Use it on roblox.com
3. Find .ROBLOSECURITY and copy everything.
## Tutorial (part 2)
7. Paste your cookie in the "Input your cookie" field.
8. If all done correctly, a verification link will be generated.

# Note
You need a government-issued document to do the verification process, whether its an ID, passport or driver's license (how do you have a license and have an acc with the birthday being 2018 lmao). Happy verifying!
