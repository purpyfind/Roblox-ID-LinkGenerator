# Roblox Age Verifier
A new Roblox age verification method. Requires your cookies but doesn't store them in places other than the script. Taken from RobloxDevs, with a tutorial. Generates a verification link regardless of the account birthday, proven to work by me and a couple of Malitur Studio members.

Requirements:
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code (any version)
- Axios (run "npm i axios")
- Basic VS Code knowledge
